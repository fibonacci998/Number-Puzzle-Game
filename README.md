The number-puzzle (also called Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle exists in some sizes. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle are called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

History
The eight-puzzle is a smaller version of the fifteen-puzzle, which was invented in 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York. The puzzle made its way to Hartford, Connecticut, where students in the American school of the Deaf started manufacturing the puzzle and, by December 1879, selling both locally and Boston. Then the puzzle became a craze in the U.S. in Feb 1880.
